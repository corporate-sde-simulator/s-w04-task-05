# Meeting Notes - Sprint 26 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Ravi Iyer (Lead), Deepak Gupta, Intern

---

## Form validation rule engine

- **Ravi Iyer:** This is blocking our release. Deepak Gupta started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Deepak Gupta:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `ruleEngine.js` and `validationRules.js`
- [ ] @Deepak Gupta - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Ravi Iyer - Final sign-off before merge
